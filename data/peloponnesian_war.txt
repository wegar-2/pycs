The State of Greece from the earliest Times to the Commencement of the Peloponnesian War
Thucydides, an Athenian, wrote the history of the war between the Peloponnesians and the Athenians, beginning at the
moment that it broke out, and believing that it would be a great war and more worthy of relation than any that had
preceded it. This belief was not without its grounds. The preparations of both the combatants were in every department
in the last state of perfection; and he could see the rest of the Hellenic race taking sides in the quarrel; those who
delayed doing so at once having it in contemplation. Indeed this was the greatest movement yet known in history, not
only of the Hellenes, but of a large part of the barbarian worldâ€”I had almost said of mankind. For though the events of
remote antiquity, and even those that more immediately preceded the war, could not from lapse of time be clearly
ascertained, yet the evidences which an inquiry carried as far back as was practicable leads me to trust, all point to
the conclusion that there was nothing on a great scale, either in war or in other matters.
